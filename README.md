# 2048

### Intro
This app was inspired by two things - first, my original 2048 that I programmed during my Operating Systems course in my second year of University - https://github.com/atararazin/2048. 

The second was React's "Intro to React" tutorial - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html, which taught the basics of React by building a Tic Tac Toe game. This reminded me how much fun building games is, so I thought I'd give it a shot and on the way, practice web developement.
